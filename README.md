# Because GitHub doesn't allow serving GitHub pages from another branch than the master branch, I'll post the redesign-2020 here

# The master branch **will** contains the most up do date version of my website.

At least that's the idea. It's completely possible that that won't be true at all as I forget, neglect or don't prioritise updating this repo. 

Hopefully, the changes won't be that big, and I'll make sure to upate the repo whenever I do a drastic change.
